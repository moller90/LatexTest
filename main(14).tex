In this exercise we will use the pumping lemma to show that L is not context free.

$$ L= \{ a^i b^j c^k | i < j < k \} $$
    
    We let $ u = a^n b^{n+1} c^{n+2} $. Given this string and knowing a condition stating  $ |u| \geq n $. We define $ u $ as $ vwxyz $ such that $ |wxy| \leq n, |vx| > 0 $.\\
    Because $ |wxy| \leq n $, there are five possible descriptions of $ uvwxy $, we number them 1 to 5:
        
\begin{enumerate}
  \item wxy only consists of $ a $'s.
  \item wxy only consists of $ b $'s.
  \item wxy only consists of $ c $'s.
  \item wxy consists of some $ a $'s followed by $ b $'s
  \item wxy consists of some $ b $'s followed by $ c $'s.
\end{enumerate}
    
    \input{cond.tex}
    
        Because $ |wxy| \leq n $, $wxy$ cannot contain both $a$'s and $c$'s.\\
        For this language to be contexst free, all cases $ v w^m x y^m z$, for $ m \geq 0 $, have to be in the language.\\
        
        Case 1 and 2: If we let $m=2$ we will be adding an $ a $ to the string, thus making the
        number of $a$'s be $n+1$ and therefore the string is not in the language.\\
        It is the same with case 2 in which the number of $b$'s will be
        equal to the number of $c$'s.
        
        Case 3: If $ m=0 $ the number of $c$'s will be less than or equal
        the number of $b$'s.
        
        Case 4: If $ m=2 $ either the number of $ a $'s will be greater than the
        number of $ b $'s or the number of $ b $'s will be greater than the number of
        $ c $'s.
        
        Case 5: If $ m=0 $ either the number of $ b $ 's will be less than or equal
        to number of $ a $'s or the number of $ a $'s will be less than or equal to
        the number of $ b $'s.
        
        It is now shown that the language L is not context free.
