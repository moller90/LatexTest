\section*{Exercise 1}
In exercise 1 we are asked to trace the letrec-declared lambda abstraction.\\
The traced "add$\_$revisited" and "add$\_$revisited$\_$alt":

\input{1a.tex}

Furthermore we are asked to program mul, pow and fac using local recursive procedures. Which we have some running exampels:

\input{1b.tex}

\section*{Exercise 5}
In this exercise, we are asked to implement three structurally
recursive procedure: proper-list-ref, proper-list-tail and proper-list-head. these respectively emulate the predefined procedures list-ref, list-head and list-tail:
\input{5.tex}

\section*{Exercise 8}
In this exercise we will write an procedure "set-normalize" which will yeald an imput list but without dublications.\\
Exampels on the procedure set-normalize:
\input{8.tex}

\section*{Exercise 9}
In this exercise, we will implement "set-union", "set-intersection", and "set-difference" over representations of sets.
lists of elements without duplication:
\input{9.tex}
I am not quite sure about what i am doing wrong, a hint could be helpful.
\section*{Exercise 20}
In this exercise we modify run-byte-code-program so it does not operate on numbers anymore but rather representations of numbers:

\input{20.tex}

Rather than calculation the numbers we get syntactic representations of calculations.
