In this exercise we will use the pumping lemma to show the following language cannot be accepted by an FA:
    $$ L= \{ a^i b^j a^k | k > i + j \} $$
For this we will use proof by contradiction.\\
Suppose for the sake of contradiction that L can be described by an FA with n states. We let $ x = a^n b a^{n+2} $ thus $ x \in L $.\footnote{We cannot choose the last a to be $ a^{n+1} $ because it would not hold the $ k > j+i $ condition.}\\
Then, because L can be described by an FA, and have to satisfy:
    \input{Conditions.tex}
Because we have chosen the first $ n $ symbols of $ x $ to be a, and $ |uv| \leq n \wedge |v| > 0 $ we can conclude that the string $ v $ must be $ a^j $ for some $ j > 0 $ and therefore must $ u v^2 w = a^{n+j} b a^{n+2} $.\\
Which is an contradiction: 
    $$ u v^2 w \in L \text{ but } n+j+1	\not< n+2 $$
The Pumping lemma was used to prove how the language $ L= \{ a^i b^j a^k | k > i + j \} $ could not be accepted by an FA.
